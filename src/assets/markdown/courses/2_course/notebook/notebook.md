#### Laboratory Notebooks and Reports    
<br>

##### Administrative Details
You will need a laboratory notebook with duplicate perforated pages. Notebook copies should be handed to your instructors at the end of each lab period.
Completed lab report sheets should be handed in one week after all parts of the experiment are completed
Lab reports for make-ups are due one week after make-up day.

##### Reasons for Keeping a Well-Organized Laboratory Notebook
Laboratory work in science requires certain talents. However, no matter how talented a researcher might be in devising and carrying out experiments, this work will have no impact upon the scientific community unless it is communicated to others. Thus, along with talent in the laboratory, a competent researcher must be able to organize, analyze, and convey the results and conclusions to others. The basis for good scientific communication is a clear, concise, and organized record of the work, which has been carried out in the laboratory. 

To fulfill this requirement, any well-organized format for a laboratory notebook is sufficient. However, in a course in which the work of many students has to be evaluated by a small number of instructors, efficiency and accuracy of evaluation require a certain uniformity of format. When evaluators know where to find the required information, they can focus their major effort on the work and on giving students suggestions on how to improve their laboratory work and reports. Consequently, a specific order and placement of information is outlined in the following section. By following this outline, you will assure that your work will receive maximum consideration.

###### **1. General Format and Procedures**
  1. On the front cover of the book, write your name and laboratory day.
  2. Number all the pages (right-hand), if not already numbered.
  3. Reserve the first page of the book for the Table of Contents. During the semester enter the name of each experiment, the date on which it was performed, and the pages on which it was recorded.
  4. Each page that is used to record procedure, observations, or results obtained in the laboratory should be dated to indicate the day the experiment was done.
  5. Before leaving the laboratory each day, books must be initiated by an instructor, and the duplicate copies handed to the instructor.

  
###### **2. Format for Laboratory Notebook Writing**
The following outline presents essentially all items that might be required in any experiment. Some experiments may not require all items, but the order and position of sections should always be as indicated.

**a. Title of the experiment**

- A new experiment should always be started on a new page. A detailed title should be written at the top of the page.

**b. Pre-lab Assignments – Table of Physical Constants**

- This is a written exercise to be completed before each laboratory period. It is a list of names, structures, molecular formulae, as well as important physical and chemical properties** of the compounds used in the experiment. This table should be completed in the notebook immediately following the title.

- **Very Important:** List only the properties that you think you are going to use in your experiment. For example, if you are going to distill the compound you prepared, then you should know the boiling points of all the compounds that are involved in this reaction. However, it is irrelevant what the densities and refractive indices are, if these properties are not used to identify the compounds.

**c. Reference**

- References used for the Table of Constants, as well as for writing the Procedure has to be listed here. This should contain references, with page number or section designations, to all sources used in preparing the
lab write-up, including the Laboratory Manual, Handbooks, and any on-line references.

- Useful website about references:

**d. Equations**

- When chemical reactions occur, balanced equations for the reactions  should be written using structural formulae (NOT condensed formulae) of the organic compounds. Equations should be placed under the Table of Physical Constants or on the next page, if there is not enough space under the Table of Physical Constants.

**e. Procedure and Observations / Data**

**Each page should be divided into two columns (most lab notebooks have two columns), with headings of Procedure for one and Observation/Data for the second column.**

- **Procedural** steps should be sequentially numbered and written after both the equations and table. The steps should be separated by at least a few lines to allow for any modifications, which might be necessary in the laboratory. Procedural steps should be concise, complete sentences. The narrative should be in the third person passive. (E.g., “The two solutions were mixed and heated to boiling.”) Procedure should be written as part of the pre-lab assignment for each experiment and must be done before coming to lab. It should be clear, legible, and complete enough to permit any chemist to repeat your work easily by following your notebook description of what was done.

- **Observations** for procedures should appear on the right-hand column directly opposite the procedural steps (as much as possible) and be designated with the same numbers of the procedural steps to which they refer. Observations are usually used as indications that an experiment is progressing smoothly.

- **Data** accumulated in the lab, such as weights, volumes, melting points, boiling points, drawings of TLC plates, etc., should be included as a part of Observations. The name and make of any instrument used should always be noted. **Whenever possible, data should be reported in concise, carefully constructed tables.**
Every page with **Data** or **Observations** must have a **Date**.

**f. Calculations and Summary of Results**

- This section should begin on the next page after Procedure and Observations/Data. Calculations should be shown clearly. **Always include a Results Table** with relevant experimental values, e.g., melting points, percentage recovery or yield, etc. The information should be clearly labeled so that it can be readily cited in the Discussion section.

_Sample Table for the summary of results_

| Unknown Number           | m.p. (°C) | weight (g) | %   |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------|-----|
| Acid component (name)    | ...       | ...        | ... |
| Neutral component (name) | ...       | ...        | ... |

**g. Study Questions**

- These questions are to help you understand the material. Answers to these questions are not required for your lab report.


##### Format for Chemistry 3328 Lab Reports

Your lab write-up will be short (typically 2-3 pages, plus any Supporting Information). Be sure to follow the style shown for the sample lab report. The sample report is available as a Microsoft Word file from the course website at http://courseworks.columbia.edu. Download that file and use it as a template for preparing your lab reports. Here is a description of what we are looking for in the various sections of the lab report.

**a. Title:** Experiment title, your name, your section, and the date. Fairly self-explanatory.

**b. Abstract:** The Abstract is a very brief (typically a sentence or two) summary of what you accomplished in the lab. It is very similar to the abstract you were used to writing in your General Chemistry reports.

**c. Discussion:** In the Discussion section, provide a bit of background on your motivation for undertaking the experiment. Also provide some details on how well the experiment worked, and discuss mechanistic issues if you think it appropriate. If you wish to give an overview of how you made structural assignments, this is a good place to do it. However, you do not need to get into all the gory details; just provide the highlights. A paragraph or two is usually enough for the entire Discussion section. The main points that should be included are given for each experiment in the lab manual.

**d. Conclusion:** State the main Conclusions you reached as a result of completing the experiment. Were you successful in identifying the unknown or separating a mixture, etc., If there was some other objective to the laboratory, was it achieved? A couple of sentences ought to do it for the Conclusion section. Be sure to include the main result of the experiment.

**e. Supporting Information:** Under Supporting Information, provide a list of the items that you are handing in with the lab report. Typically, this supplementary material will include most of the following:
  
  - Copies of laboratory notebook pages: We collect the carbon copies from your notebook each lab period and so we will have it.
  - Spectra with assignments: Draw the structure of the compound on each
spectrum and clearly assign peaks to the functional groups.


**f. General Experimental:** This should include the names of the instruments used and the units in which the data was recorded. It should note any special conditions that were employed in the experiment.

**g. Experimental Procedure and Observations:** Write the detailed procedure with corresponding observations embedded in it.


**h. References:** In the References section list any sources cited in your laboratory report using the proper format. Please see [How to Cite Sources in Scientific Writing](www.instruction.greenriver.edu/mcvay/B100/how_to_cite_sources_in_scientifi.htm) for citing references. Finally, be sure to cite any electronic resources you use.

**Please proofread and spellcheck your report. Also, be sure that you are writing in simple and complete sentences: have a subject and verb, and make sure these agree.**
