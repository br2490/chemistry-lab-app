    </ol>
<p><b>B. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</b></p>

<p>
    Nutmeg powder is a mixture of many essential oils and oleoresins. In this experiment, you will extract trimyristin from nutmeg powder and recrystallize trimyristin.</p>
<p>
    Recrystallization is one of the most important purification techniques used in organic chemistry. Recrystallization is used to purify solids contaminated by relatively small amounts of solid impurities. Compounds having different solubilities at different temperatures can generally be recrystallized. For most compounds, the solubility increases as the temperature of the solvent increases. In practice, this means that a suitable solvent for recrystallization is one in which there is a large difference between the solubility of the compound in hot solvent compared with that in cold solvent. A compound which dissolves to form a saturated solution at or near the boiling point of a suitable solvent can be largely recovered since it will come out of the solvent, or recrystallize, when the solution is cooled. If the compound is impure, removal of insoluble impurities (by gravity filtration) is accomplished with the desired product dissolved in the hot solution. Other impurities remain largely dissolved even when the solution is cooled because they are more soluble and/or present in much smaller amounts than the desired product. Recrystallizations are designed, by proper use of solvents, to maximize the yield and purity, although the degree of recovery and quality often vary inversely.</p>
<p><b>Choice of a suitable solvent:</b></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The desired compound should be very soluble in the hot solvent.</li>
        <li>The desired compound is very insoluble in the cold solvent.</li>
        <li>The solvent should be easily removable (fairly volatile) from the desired product.</li>
    </ol>
<p><b>Choice of a solvent pair:</b></p>
<p>
    Sometimes no single solvent can fill the requirements of suitability. In such cases, two miscible solvents (solvent pair) can be combined to produce a suitable solvent. Criteria for solvents in a solvent pair are:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The desired compound will be relatively soluble in solvent #1 even when the solvent is cold.</li>
        <li>The compound will be relatively insoluble in solvent #2 even when the solvent is hot.</li>
        <li>Solvent #1 and solvent #2 must be miscible.</li>
    </ol>
<p>
    A combination of two miscible solvents as described will often provide a solvent pair in which there is a large difference between the solubility of the compound in hot and cold solvent.</p>
<p><b>Solubility</b></p>
    <p>
        The theory of solubility is simplistically described by the phrase “like dissolves like,” i.e., solutes tend to dissolve in solvents of similar, or like polarity. Some commonly used solvents for recrystallization are pentane, hexane, toluene, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, and water.</p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, we will use acetone, diethyl ether, toluene, methanol, and water as solvents. Of these solvents, toluene is the least polar, and water is the most polar. The normal procedure for the purification of a compound by recrystallization is to predict its solubility on the basis of its structure and then to test its solubility in a variety of solvents. Once a suitable solvent is found, that compound can be recrystallized.
    </p>
<p><b>Theory of Extraction</b></p>
<p>The transfer of a solute from one phase to another is a very common technique in organic chemistry. It is called extraction, and it is also a common technique in everyday life. When you steep a tea bag in boiling water, add a bay leaf to a pot of soup, or wash a load of laundry, you are performing a solid/liquid extraction, in which a solution containing several components is mixed with a second, immiscible liquid, for the purpose of extracting one component of the solution into the second solvent.</p>
<br>
<p><b>C. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</b></p>
    <p><div class="a"><b>Week 1</b></div></p>
    <ol>
        <p><li><b>Solubility Tests</b></p>
        <p>
            <b>Find a suitable solvent for the recrystallization of triphenylmethane.</b></p>
        <p>
            Test the solubility of pure triphenylmethane in all three solvents. The solubility tests should be done side by side. Place about 20 mg of solute, the tip of a spatula full, in each of three test tubes (one for each solvent). Add about 1 mL of solvent to each test tube and grind the solute to subdivide the particles as much as possible. Observe and note the amount of solid, not yet drawing conclusions about solubility. Heat test tubes with stirring in a steam bath. Even very soluble compounds may take several minutes to dissolve; however, prolonged heating may result in evaporation of solvent. Take care to distinguish melting from dissolving; a solute with melting point below the temperature of the steam bath or boiling point of the solvent (see your Table of Physical Constants) may melt yet not dissolve, or melt first and then dissolve. Observe the amount of solid remaining, if any, in the hot solvent, and record your estimation of solubility in the table. Place the test tube in an ice bath and observe and note the amount of recrystallized product, if any.</p>
        <p>
            Refer to the structures of the solvents and solute to give a tentative prediction of the solubilities on the basis of polarity. This will help you develop a sense of lab work as you compare theoretical prediction with actual result. Remember, as you fill in the table, that the results are a matter of degree, judged more by correct trend than by actual number of ‘+’s and ‘-‘s. Record your Results in the Solubility Table in your notebook.</p>

    <br>
        <b>+</b> slightly soluble, less than half of the sample dissolved.
    <br>
        <b>Crystals</b> if crystals formed when cooled</p>
    <li><b>Extraction of Trimyristin</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Weigh out exactly about 4.0000 g of nutmeg powder on weighing paper.
                <br>
                Record the exact weight to four decimal places.</li>
            <li>Transfer the nutmeg to a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask using a powder funnel.  Measure 25 mL of diethyl ether in a graduated cylinder, and add the diethyl ether to the nutmeg in the flask. Swirl the mixture many times over a period of about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Weigh a 100 mL Round Bottomed Flask (RBF). Record the exact weight to four decimal places.</li>
            <li>Place the RBF on a cork ring. Place a short stem funnel with a fluted fast flow filter paper in it.</li>
            <li>Filter the solution in the Erlenmeyer flask by pouring it quickly and carefully onto the filter paper.</li>
            <li>Wash the residue in the Erlenmeyer flask three times with 1 mL portions of diethyl ether. Filter each wash into the RBF.</li>
            <li>Remove diethyl ether using the rotary evaporator (RotoVap).</li>
            <li>Weigh the RBF and determine the weight of crude trimyristin.</li>
            <li>Set aside a small amount of crude trimyristin (a spatula tipful) in a small test tube, for melting point. Use the rest for recrystallization.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
  <p><div class="a"><b>Week 2</b></div></p>
    <li><b>Recrystallization of Trimyristin</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>On a steam bath, heat 20 mL of solvent (acetone) in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a boiling chip to the RBF containing crude trimyristin. (Boiling chips should never be added to a hot solution). Add 7 mL of warm solvent to the RBF.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to boiling on the steam bath, and swirl occasionally. Add additional solvent, 1 mL at a time, until solid is completely dissolved. Use only minimum volume of hot solvent necessary to dissolve the crude product.</li>
            <li>Add an extra 2 mL of solvent to the RBF to avoid premature crystallization. Transfer this hot solution into a 100 or 150 mL beaker.</li>
            <p><b>The following procedure must be done quickly and efficiently, so that glassware stays hot and the loss of solvent by evaporation is kept to a minimum.</b></p>
            <li>When the flask is “emptied,” rinse it with two 5 mL portions of hot solvent. Transfer each rinse to the same beaker. Keep this beaker on the steam bath and bring it to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li>When the solution comes to a gentle boil, remove the beaker from the steam bath. Carefully set the solution aside and allow it to recrystallize until it cools to room temperature. Then, cool it in an ice bath for 10 minutes. While the solution is cooling, set up the vacuum filtration apparatus. Also, cool about 10 mL of fresh solvent in a small beaker in an ice bath (to be used in step <b>f</b>, below).</li>
        </ol></li> <br>
    <li><b>Melting Points and Weight of Product</b>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Weigh an empty vial, transfer the purified trimyristin, and reweigh. Record the weights. </li>  
            <li>Determine the melting points of recrystallized trimyristin and the original crude trimyristin side by side, and record the values.</li>
            <li>Label the vial with your name, the identity of contents, i.e., “Purified Trimyristin,” lab day, <u>weight of product,</u> % recovery from nutmeg, and <u>melting point</u> of contents.</li>
            <li>Place the vial containing the recrystallized product in the box for your lab day on the front desk.</li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>
<p><b>D. STUDY QUESTIONS</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Given the solubility results shown in the table below, choose the most suitable solvent or solvent pair for recrystallizing each compound.  Neither water nor ethanol is miscible with ligroine (mixed hexanes), and water does not mix with toluene.</li>
        <img src=TrimiristinExtraction_SolubilityTable_StudyQuestion.png alt="Solubility Table"/>
        <br>Please keep your answers to the following questions brief.<br>
        <li>If extracted crude trimyristin were a white crystalline solid, should Norite be used in the recrystallization?  Explain.</li>
        <li>Why is some trimyristin lost each time it is washed with fresh cold solvent while in the Büchner funnel?</li>
        <li>If the melting point of purified trimyristin was determined before the sample was completely dry, what errors would most likely result? Explain.</li>
        <li>Naphthalene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with m.p. = 80 &#8451;. Is toluene likely to be a good solvent for recrystallization of naphthalene?  (Hint: Find the structure of naphthalene, and the structure and boiling point of toluene.)</li>
        </ol>
<p><b>E. RESULTS</b></p>
