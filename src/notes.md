#### Notes:

##### Consolidate card components
- Experiment cards should be one component (maybe two, due to some differences) that takes as props the data it needs.
- Likewise for Courses

##### API / Data Updates

- Add keys *experiments.json*:
	- Backgrounds
	- discussion
	- results
	- waste_disposal
	- study_questions
- Should these keys be stored as JSON as well, with the accompanying APIs?

##### NavBar
 - Remove redundancies

##### Style
 - Standardize naming conventions (mixed use of xID & xId, etc.)
