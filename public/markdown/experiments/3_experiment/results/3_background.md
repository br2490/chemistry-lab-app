#### Theoretical Definition of Melting Point
The melting point of a solid is the temperature at which the solid and its liquid form are in equilibrium, i.e., molecules move back and forth between the two states at the same rate, so both phases remain present. If the temperature of a solid is measured carefully as the solid is heated, the temperature will be observed to rise until the melting point (m.p.) of the solid is reached, and then the temperature will remain almost constant while the solid melts. The heat absorbed during melting is the “heat of fusion,” the energy needed to move the molecules out of the crystal lattice of the solid. When the solid has completely melted, the addition of more heat again contributes to an increase in the temperature of the sample, now a liquid. This describes the melting of a pure solid. The melting point is characteristic of the compound, independent of source, purification procedure, etc., and is useful in identifying the compound. However, many different compounds have identical or very similar melting points.

#### Functional Definition of Melting Point

Strictly speaking, the melting point is never a “point”. It is invariably a narrow range, about 1 &deg;C for most compounds, but 0.5 &deg;C for some, 1.5 – 2.0 &deg;C for others. Part of the range is an experimental artifact. Since heat transfer is often uneven, all parts of a solid sample are unlikely to be at the same temperature simultaneously. While some regions of the sample may be at the melting point (solid and liquid in equilibrium), other regions may be at slightly higher or lower temperatures. Thus, visible melting will occur over a range of temperatures. Therefore, the proper report of a melting point is the temperature range from the first visible appearance of liquid (distinguished from “softening” of the crystal) to the disappearance of the last visible crystal of solid. The end is the most important point, but the whole range is needed for full interpretation (e.g. benzoic acid, m.p. = 120 – 121.5 &deg;C).

Melting points for many organic compounds may be found in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (hbcponline.com). These “literature” melting points are taken from reports in the chemical literature and indicate the melting range or upper end of the melting range of very pure samples of compounds. Consequently, these values are the highest values that can be expected for each compound. (See below for effects of impurities on melting points.) In some cases, more than one melting point will be listed for a single compound. This usually means that the compound can exist in more than one type of crystal lattice and that the different types have different stabilities and thus will break down at different temperatures.

#### Effects of an “Impurity”
If two different compounds, A and B, are intimately mixed, the melting point behavior of the mixture differs from that of either pure compound. When a small portion of B is mixed with A, the upper limit of the melting point range of A is lowered. Increasing the amount of B in A continuously decreases the upper limit of the melting range of the resultant mixture until such point that B ceases to be the impurity in A, and A then becomes the impurity in B. The point at which this occurs is called the eutectic; the eutectic temperature and composition of a mixture varies with the nature of the components A and B.

The melting point of a eutectic mixture is below that of either pure A or pure B and is the lowest temperature at which any mixture of A and B can melt. The lower limit of the melting range of all mixtures of A and B is actually equal to the eutectic temperature because that part of the mixtures which is of the eutectic composition melts at the eutectic temperature. Actual observation of the true lower limit is difficult in all mixtures and impossible in mixtures containing little of one component. In most mixtures, the small amount of material that consists of the eutectic composition, and therefore melts first, is obscured by the relatively large amount of remaining “pure” component. The upper limit of the melting range is more readily observed, since it is much easier to note the disappearance of the last crystal in the liquid than appearance of the first drop of liquid in the mass of solid. The upper limit of the melting range of a compound containing an impurity is always lower than that of the pure compound.

#### Mixed Melting Points
The melting point of a compound is a physical characteristic often used to identify the compound and provide information about its purity. Pure compounds melt sharply. The presence of an impurity in a sample lowers the upper end of the melting range and very often causes the observed melting range to be wider than that of the pure compound. Therefore, if two samples of similar melting point are intimately mixed, and the melting point of the mixture is not “depressed” or “broadened,” the two samples are the same compound. As a corollary, if the melting point of the mixture is depressed and possibly broadened, the two samples cannot be the same compound. When attempting to identify a compound by the mixed melting point method, it is critical to observe the melting behavior of the unknown and standard side by side with the mixture. The procedure gives a direct comparison of the mixture with the standards and allows you to observe any variation of melting behavior between samples under your experimental conditions. It is also useful to test a second possibility to assure that under the conditions of your experiment the technique is capable of distinguishing between different compounds.
