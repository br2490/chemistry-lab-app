#### General Procedures

###### **a. Filling the Melting Point Capillary Tube**
- Points to remember: Use the spatula attached to each bottle to take small samples (the tip of the spatula) on labeled pieces of paper. To avoid contamination, never return excess samples to bottles; instead, share with a neighbor. Grind the samples several times with a spatula on weighing paper to form a fine powder. This will facilitate uniform heat transfer throughout the sample. If melting points are to be compared, they should be taken side by side when possible. Fill one m.p. capillary tube for each sample or each mixture, and store all tubes in slits in labeled papers.

###### **b. The Melting Point**
- The melting point in a capillary tube is taken as the temperature range between the appearance of the first droplet and the disappearance of the last crystal. A shrinking or milking may be visible a few degrees below the melting point. The actual melting range should be determined slowly over a period of 30 sec. This can be achieved by having a proper ramp rate.

###### **c. Use of the Digimelt Melting Point Apparatus**
- Instructions for using the Digimelt apparatus will be available in the laboratory.


#### Procedure for the Lab Period
---

##### **Check in**

- Do this as time permits.
- Check each item in your drawer and cupboard against the Check List. Be sure all glassware is clean and unbroken. There is a labeled display of apparatus available in the laboratory. On a separate sheet of paper, make a list of missing items, so that the instructor can get them for you; include your name and desk number. Sign your check list and return it to the instructor.


##### **Melting Points (Temperatures should be recorded to the first decimal place)**

1. Standard compounds and unknown compounds will be available on the reagent shelf.
2. Identification of your unknown: Record the number of your unknown and then prepare a capillary for determining its melting point. This sample will be used to determine a rough melting point, so that you can choose the two best possibilities from the standards for further comparison.
3. Attach melting point tube prepared in step 2 to a labeled slit in paper.Take the tube to a Digimelt apparatus and insert the tube. As the sample melts, record the melting point range of the sample directly in your lab notebook.  
4. Your unknown is one of the compounds listed in your pre-lab assignment. Devise a procedure to identify your unknown by mixed melting point method. Describe this procedure in your notebook. Record all data in a table under observation and data. When comparing melting point values, experimental results should be obtained side by side when possible.
